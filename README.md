## ‚¨áÔ∏è Install

You can either invite the bot [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=764503316352466984&scope=bot&permissions=738577479)
or clone the repo and make some code out of it!

(‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: you might want to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to follow this process!)
With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) and [git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your device,

Make a folder for the code:

```
$ mkdir folder_name
```

Navigate to that folder:

```
$ cd folder_name
```

Clone the repo on that folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SweetieRick/Simple-Memer-Bot.git
```

Then inside that folder install all the dependencies with:

```
$ npm i
```

Almost there: Get your personal [bot token](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) and [make a bot](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications) and finally just open the **.env** file and put your token at the key 'TOKEN':

```
TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Last step: Issue the command:

```
$ npm run start
```

Or:

```
$ node index.js
```

... And you have the bot up and running!
To invite it to a guild, follow [this step by step guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) and if you have trouble, try to Google the solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) or make a question yourself!
For management purposes, we can't provide any help on the installation if you open an issue on the repo, so please avoid to do so as it will be automatically closed!
